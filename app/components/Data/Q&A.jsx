    question: "What can I expect from our first session?",
    answer:
      "Our first session is a chance for us to get to know each other. We’ll talk about what brought you here, what you’re hoping for, and any concerns you might have. There’s no pressure to share everything at once — we move at a pace that feels comfortable for you."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to have a clear goal before starting?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. Many people come in feeling confused, overwhelmed, or unsure of what they need. Part of our work together is helping you gain clarity and understand what support looks like for you."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does each session last?",
    answer:
      "Each session typically lasts around 50 minutes. This gives us enough time to explore what’s coming up for you while keeping the process focused and manageable."
  },
  {
    question: "Is everything I share kept confidential?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your privacy is deeply respected. Everything discussed in our sessions is confidential, with very limited exceptions required by law to ensure safety."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if this is the right fit for me?",
    answer:
      "Feeling comfortable and supported is essential. If at any point something doesn’t feel right, we can talk about it openly. Therapy is a collaborative process, and your experience matters."
